******************************************************************************
  To set Braille Character, append lines to WinBES99 configuration file "special.def". 
  You can find "special.def" in WinBES99 install folder, C:\Program Files\WIN-BES
  or C:\Program Files (x86)\WIN-BES.

  Folloing string in the default set 

    "~ﾟ["  : Single Quotation(‘) _
    "~ﾟ],  : Single Quotation(’)
    "~ﾟ||" : Double poem line splitter(／／)", _
    "~ﾟﾏﾙ" : Censored word:○
    "~ﾟｻﾝｶ": Censored word:△
    "~ﾟｼｶｸ": Censored word:□
    "~ﾟｶｹ" : Censored word:×
    "~ﾟｿﾉﾀ": Other Censored word

  is on the assumption that following lines are assed to special.def.

    "~ﾟ[",    CT_J5, CT_E5, 0x20, 0x26, 0x00
    "~ﾟ]",    CT_J6, CT_E6, 0x34, 0x04, 0x00
    "~ﾟ||",   CT_J2, CT_E2, 0x38, 0x38, 0x00
    "~ﾟﾏﾙ",   CT_J7, CT_E7, 0x10, 0x35, 0x00
    "~ﾟｻﾝｶ",  CT_J7, CT_E7, 0x10, 0x37, 0x00
    "~ﾟｼｶｸ",  CT_J7, CT_E7, 0x10, 0x3d, 0x00
    "~ﾟｶｹ",   CT_J7, CT_E7, 0x10, 0x3f, 0x00
    "~ﾟｿﾉﾀ",  CT_J7, CT_E7, 0x10, 0x3e, 0x00

  By no documentaion about special.def format, this issue is based on my supposition.
     Column 1:this, up to 5 chars, string is translated to Braille string on sinse 4th column.
       Starting string "~ﾟ" (UpperLine+Hankaku Katakana Handakuon) is never occurs in Japanese text.
       DoublwWidth Char first column is not work.
    Column 2,3:J means Japanese, E Means English, but digit meaning is unknown.
      It may be indicate "insert space before/after" or "opening/closing of someting".
      CT_J2,CT_E2 inserts space before and after, CT_J7,CT_E7 inserts no space.
    Column 4-->:null terminationg Braille string.
      Pin point 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respond to 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20.
      Eg. 0x38 is 0x10+0x20+0x08, then  pin 4,5, and 6 are ON.
